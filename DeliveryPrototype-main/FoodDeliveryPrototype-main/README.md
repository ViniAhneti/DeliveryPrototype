# FoodDeliveryPrototype
Prototip per detyre ne web development
The Head and Body were self-made a bit from watching videos and checking out other sites,the Footer was copied and modified mostly and still have work to do there and the css were mostly copied and  modified(some self made because of errors) especially the colors.I was only able to finish these parts correctly home/restaurant/login and About,while the other parts are still in development(foundations made for most of them but yet to be designed).I'm representing it as a prototype since I found out a bit late that the project would be separated in parts that being the main reason the other one being I've yet to fully decide whether it's going to be foreign tourist focused or local people and it ended up getting a bit complicated for now.My colleague helped me quite a bit but we separated our projects because he wanted to do a more basic one with what was learned in University while I wanted something larger and a bit more complex(Giving my thanks to Granit for his help and apologies to him since I happened to be busy the whole month for workplace and health issues).Chances are that the project(at least this one) will end up looking a lot different at the end or stay with the same design but be more basic-Ervin Ahmeti 192047186.
