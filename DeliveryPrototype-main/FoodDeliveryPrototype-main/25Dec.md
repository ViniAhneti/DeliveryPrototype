New plan and changes:
1.Main goal from now on is going to be to get a grade and pass the subject,no more trying to make something I can actually use outside University.
2.The footer is a must Remove/Replace especially if I want to get the frontend finished next week.
3.The plan is going to be different for the food delivery,simplyfing it by a lot is a must do(no more trying to use all resturants in the city or something like all Resturant categories,something which was randomly created in a hurry)the css and airstyle is good looking for the future(simple fashion).
4.Decide if I should start checking all the minor code errors from now or until I'm actually done with the code yet still not finished with the project.
5.Finish all this next week(also check out the notebook)and check out any projects I might have left before when I was in Uni as an example just in case things go wrong.
